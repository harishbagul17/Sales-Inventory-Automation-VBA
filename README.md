# ðŸ“Š Sales Inventory Automation in Excel (VBA)

This project is a fully automated Excel-based solution for generating, cleaning, analyzing, and reporting sales inventory data using **VBA macros**.

## âœ… Features

- Generates a random dataset of 100â€“200 sales entries
- Cleans and validates data (e.g., removes blanks, trims spaces, checks for valid values)
- Calculates profit for each sale
- Produces summary reports (total profit, profit by product)
- All steps are automated with reusable and modular VBA macros
